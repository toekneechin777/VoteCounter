# PURPOSE
## This program finds the election winner of votes casted by sub-areas for any number of candidates.

# COMPILE
## make clean
## make
## ./votecounter <DAG.txt> <inputdir> <outputdir> <num_threads>

# WHAT IT DOES
## The program creates a directory tree based on the input DAG file, and aggregates votes from each leaf up to
## the root node, using one thread for each leaf. The winner is displayed at the end of the file output in the
## root node. Appropropriate leaf node files are obtained from a queue, and are ensured to exist in the DAG
## before working with them.

# CONTRBUTIONS
## main function written by Anthony and Samira.
## child_task written by Anthony with help from Samira
## aggregate_votes written by Samira and debugged by Samira and Anthony
## Memory errors fixed by Samira
## Extra credit and log file implementation by Anthony
